Description: This package provides a comprehensive set of external and internal evaluation metrics. It includes 
    metrics for assessing partitions or fuzzy partitions derived from clustering results, as well as for evaluating 
    subpopulation identification results within embeddings or graph representations. Additionally, it provides metrics for 
    comparing spatial domain detection results against ground truth labels, and tools for visualizing spatial errors.
