\usage{
spatialARI(
  true,
  pred,
  location,
  normCoords = TRUE,
  lambda = 0.8,
  fbeta = 4,
  hbeta = 1,
  spotWise = FALSE,
  nChunks = NULL,
  original = FALSE,

     lambda * exp(-x * fbeta)

     lambda * (1 - exp(-x * hbeta))
 }
)
}
\arguments{
\item{true}{A vector of true class labels}

\item{pred}{A vector of predicted clusters}

\item{location}{A matrix of spatial coordinates, with dimensions as columns}

\item{normCoords}{Logical; whether to normalize the coordinates to 0-1.}

\item{lambda}{The \code{alpha} used in the \code{f} and \code{h} functions (default 0.8) in
Yan, Feng and Luo, 2025.}

\item{fbeta, hbeta}{Additional factors used in the exponential decay functions
(see details). A higher value means a faster decay. These are ignored if
\code{original=TRUE}.}

\item{spotWise}{Logical; whether to return the spot-wise spatial concordance
(not adjusted for chance).}

\item{nChunks}{The number of processing chunks. If NULL, this will be
determined automatically based on the size of the dataset, so as to remain
below 2GB RAM usage.}

\item{original}{Logical; whether to use the original h/f functions from Yan,
Feng and Luo (default FALSE). If set to TRUE, the arguments \code{fbeta},
\code{hbeta}, \code{f} and \code{h} are ignored.}

\item{f}{The f function, which determines the positive contribution of pairs
that are in different partitions in the reference, but grouped together in
the clustering, based on the distance between mates.}

\item{h}{The h function, which determines the positive contribution of pairs
that are in the same partition in the reference, but different ones in
the clustering, based on the distance between mates.}
}
\value{
A vector containing the spatial Rand Index (spRI) and spatial
adjusted Rand Index (spARI). Alternatively, if \code{spotWise=TRUE}, a vector
of spatial pair concordances for each spot.
}
\description{
Computes the spatial Rand Index and spatial ARI (Yan, Feng and Luo, 2025).
Note that by default, the decay functions are different from those of the
original publication (see details for more information), but the latter can
be replicated with \code{original=TRUE}.
}
\details{
This is a reimplementation of the method from the \code{spARI} package, made more
scalable (i.e. a bit slower but more memory-efficient) through chunk-based
processing, extensible to more than 2 dimensions, and with some additional
options.
Note that by default, this will not produce the same results as the original
method: to do so, set \code{original=TRUE}. In our exploration of the method and
its behavior, we found the decay to be too slow, and we therefore 1) do not
square the distances, and 2) introduced a beta parameter in each function
which allows to scale it (a higher beta parameter means a faster decay).

By default, chunking to keep RAM usage roughly below 2GB. Higher speed can
be achieved (at higher memory costs) for larger datasets by limiting the
number of chunks. The memory usage if done in a single chunk should be
roughly \code{4e-5*nrow(location)^2} Mb, and this scales down linearly with the
number of chunks.
